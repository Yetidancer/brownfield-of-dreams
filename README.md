 <h2> Setup </h2>
 
  In this next section we will teach you how to setup the `Brown Field of Dreams` on your own local device. As always if you 
  have any feedback on how to make this setup better please leave a comment below. 
  
  Let's get started! So first off you need to find a place in your local directory that you would like to keep the
  `Brown Field of Dreams` after you have found the perfect spot lets fork and clone!! 
  
  When you know where you want to store the device then scroll to the top of this page and click on the `Fork` button

  Next We will want to clone your new copy of the `BFD` to your local device. In order to do this. first you must copy the 
  SSH. To do this click on the `Clone or download` button and then copy the link that pops up!!

  Once you have this then lets go to your terminal and in the special spot you want to store this project we are going to run
  the following command.

  You will notice that after the `git clone` command the rest of the code is simply what you copied from GitHub! Now once you
  press `return` then boom!!! you have `BFD` on your local device and you can mess with it all you want!!
